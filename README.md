## Ruby test framework for Guardian Soulmates
*Meet someone worth meeting*

An exercise in old job meeting new job. After spending two years at The Guardian and the final 4 months on Guardian Soulmates testing a successful Worldpay to Stripe payment system migration, responsive design refactor, and a shiny new rebranding (with ligatures!) it's time to move on. 
  
This repository serves the purpose of implementing the new school with the old school. Long live The Guardian!
